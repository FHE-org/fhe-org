Affordable webcams, together with cloud computing services (to run machine learning algorithms), can potentially bring significant social benefits. However, it has not been deployed in practice because of privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose a strategy that uses homomorphic encryption to resolve this dilemma, which guarantees information confidentiality while retaining action detection. Our protocol for secure inference can distinguish falls from activities of daily living with 86.21% sensitivity and 99.14% specificity, with an average inference latency of 1.2 seconds and 2.4 seconds on real-world test datasets using small and large neural nets, respectively. We show that our method enables a 613x speedup over the latency-optimized LoLa and achieves an average of 3.1x throughput increase in secure inference compared to the throughput-optimized nGraph-HE2.</td>

    <td>This blog post is part of a series of posts dedicated to the Fully Homomorphic Encryption scheme called TFHE (also known as CGGI, from the names of the authors Chillotti-Gama-Georgieva-Izabachène). Each post will allow you to go deeper into the understanding of the scheme. The subject is challenging, we know, but don’t worry, we will dive into it little by little.</td>

    <td>This guide is intended to practitioners. It explains the inner-workings of TFHE, a torus-based fully homomorphic encryption scheme. More exactly, it describes its implementation on a discretized version of the torus. It also explains in detail the technique of the programmable bootstrapping.</td>

    <td>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) has long been considered the crown jewel of cryptology and it is only recently that efficient solutions have started to emerge. Being as it is, the current state of the art of FHE still comes along with a huge expansion factor that implies an overload both in computation time and bandwidth usage. Hybrid Homomorphic Encryption, or transciphering, aims to solve the latter issue by combining the efficiency of light symmetric schemes with the computational power of FHE. In this talk, we will present an history of HHE, talk about the latest advances in the domain and address the issues that are yet to be solved.</td>

    <td>TFHE is a fully homomorphic encryption scheme that enables fast homomorphic operations on booleans, integers and reals. By enabling both leveled and bootstrapped operations, TFHE can be used for a wide range of usecases, from homomorphic boolean circuits to homomorphic neural networks. In this talk, Ilaria will do a deep dive on TFHE, and explain the key concepts behind it.</td>
