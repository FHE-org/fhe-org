# Schemes and Libraries





## Schemes
<table>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>

Schemes are the mathematical algorithms that are used for the underlying FHE operations on data. There are several major schemes implemented in modern libraries, each taking a different approach that has their own benefits and drawbacks on what types of operations can be done, the depth of calculations, and the resulting latency.

## Libraries

<table>
<tr>
<td colspan=2>

Libraries are the software developers use to perform FHE operations easily, similarly to how one might use the `libsodium` library for basic cryptographic operations. Each library is designed for working with different schemes, some with multiple schemes and the ability to switch between them as needed.

## Choosing the right scheme/library

Choosing which library/scheme is right for you can be confusing at first, but here are some considerations that help in the decision making process:

* What data types will you working with? (Large integers? Small integers / Booleans? Real / Complex values?)
* How parralelizable is your workflow?
* How deep are your typical calculations?
* What performance requirements do you have?
* How easy do you need implementation to be?
* How much existing code / support will you need?

<i>In the following section, you'll have a chance to use existing sample code and write your own code. If at that point you're still unsure which library is right for you or have deeper questions about it the libraries and schemes, consider joining the [FHE.org community on Discord](https://discord.fhe.org) and asking the community directly. We're here to help!</i>
