# Abstract

Insider attacks arising from the arbitrary inspection of customer data are becoming more prevalent. Even though privacy legislation would alleviate some of the problem, the remedy depends on self-reporting or whistleblower complaints for enforcement. Civil liberties can only be guaranteed by a mechanism that provides privacy by design.

My latest blog post (talk) on differential privacy covers mathematical foundations, reviews of potential privacy-related government legislation, and several industrial use cases.

# The speaker

Kenneth Emeka Odoh is a seasoned Software Engineer, Educator & Applied Scientist. I have a track record of delivering impactful software in several top-notch firms. In early 2023, I demonstrated a full private key recovery attack on a variant of the [Picnic Quantum Cryptography Signature scheme](https://kenluck2001.github.io/blog_post/probing_real-world_cryptosystems.html). Previously, I worked at Microsoft Corporation on a software platform that provides large-scale end-to-end video playback (transcoding) experiences and ensures faster video streaming through hardware acceleration. Before that, I worked at Intel Corporation, where I co-created a better automation framework (CI/CD) and implemented low-level telemetry support in far memory devices; worked in an IoT startup offering smart metering solutions and unsuccessfully co-founded a fintech startup that predicts financial risk from social media chatter. In graduate school, I built numerous interactive dashboards as part of Visual Analytics research with industrial collaborations. Formerly, I was a mechanical technician in P&G, and Unilever respectively.
