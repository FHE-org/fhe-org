# FHE.org 2024 — Sponsor

We are happy to announce that the 3rd Annual FHE.org Conference on Fully Homomorphic Encryption will take place on March 23rd-24th 2024. It is [colocated with RWC 2024](https://rwc.iacr.org/2024/colocated.php) and will be held in Toronto, Canada (venue TBA).

The conference will bring together researchers, developers, and businesses from the global FHE community. Both previous years at Trondheim, Norway (2022) and Tokyo, Japan (2023) brought nearly 200 participants.

Detailed information can be found on the conference webpage: https://fhe.org/2024

We are inviting sponsors for the conference. Sponsors may use the opportunity to increase their brand recognition, to get in touch with likeminded people, or to simply support progress in the field. The sponsorship funds are used to pay for event costs, support guest speakers and student attendees, and to host an after-conference reception. There is also a possibility to offer you some space for a booth or live demo.

To propose a sponsorship, drop a line to contact@fhe.org.
