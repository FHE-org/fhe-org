## How to contribute

In order to make any contributions to this repo, you'll first need to clone it, make your changes locally, then issue a Pull Request to have your changes reviewed for inclusion.



## Adding new resources

To make contributions to the resources page, you'll need to edit this file: https://github.com/FHE-org/fhe-org.github.io/blob/main/resources.md

To add a resource to the table, look around line 91 for the line `<!--- Add more resources here! --->` and include your new resource after that. Keep in mind that this table is sorted by date, so if your item is not the newest, you'll need to find the right place to insert it. Otherwise, newest items must always be added to the top of the list.

The format to use for adding a new resource is:

    <tr>
      <td>YYYY.MM.DD (date of publication)</td>
      <td><a href="https://linktoresource">Title of resource</a></td>
      <td>Description of resource (can be borrowed from resource content)</td>
      <td>Author(s)</td>
      <td>Category tag</td>
    </tr>




## Adding new use cases

To make contributions to the use cases page, you'll need to edit this file: https://github.com/FHE-org/fhe-org.github.io/blob/main/use-cases.md

To add a use case to the table, look around line 22 for the line `<!--- Add more use cases here! --->` and include your new resource after that. Keep in mind that this table is sorted by date, so if your item is not the newest, you'll need to find the right place to insert it. Otherwise, newest items must always be added to the top of the list.

The format to use for adding a new use case is:

    <tr>
      <td>YYYY.MM.DD (date of publication)</td>
      <td><a href="https://linktoresource">Title of resource</a></td>
      <td>Description of resource (can be borrowed from resource content)</td>
      <td>Author(s) / Company</td>
    </tr>
