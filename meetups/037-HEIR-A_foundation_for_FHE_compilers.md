# Abstract

HEIR (Homomorphic Encryption Intermediate Representation) is a new project that aims to build a solid foundation for FHE compilers in MLIR.

Jeremy will present HEIR's overall goals and structure, talk about how we want it to fit within the broader FHE ecosystem, describe the work we've done on it so far, and invite members of the community to contribute.

# About the speaker

Jeremy is a staff software engineer on the FHE team at Google. He has a PhD in mathematics from the University of Illinois Chicago and is the author of "A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics" and the blog "Math Intersect Programming."
