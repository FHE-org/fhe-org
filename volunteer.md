# Volunteer Program

### Want to help out at the home of the worldâ€™s top FHE cryptographers, researchers, and developers?

Weâ€™re always looking for passionate volunteers to help the FHE.org team with community, meetups, the website and conferences.

If youâ€™re a student, a developer, a researcher or have a business around FHE and want to help improve some aspect of the community, tell us about yourself and what you think you'd be most useful volunteering with! Weâ€™ve got a few special gifts to give away for volunteers so reach out today!

The best way to reach out is either directly via contact@fhe.org or through the <a href="https://discord.fhe.org/" target="_blank">community Discord</a>.
